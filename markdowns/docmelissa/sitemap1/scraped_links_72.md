Summer is here and so is the smell of amazing foods on the grill. Looking for some ideas and healthy grilling tips?  Enjoy 8 of this summer’s most deliciously healthy foods to grill up and enjoy with friends and family at your next bar-b-q.

**Fajita kabobs**

Take your love of fajitas outdoors by skewering marinated peppers and onions.  If you’re a meat eater, add some grilled chicken to your skewers. Add a little fajitas seasoning, and you’ll have a feisty barbecue dish that brings all the flavor while being kind to your health.

**Grilled watermelon**

Watermelon is a summer barbecue staple. And while it’s already good for you, tossing slices of it onto your grill is a game-changer for the palate. No one will need a sugary dessert with a treat this good. For an added layer of savory flavor, layer the grilled watermelon with feta cheese for true culinary delight!

**Grilled fish**

Fresh fish on the grill evokes images of an island vacation. No matter where you live, you can make your own version of paradise by taking fish, wrapping it with veggies like asparagus in foil packets, and throwing it atop the flames. The best part is you can use any fish you like, though the fresher, the better. Try salmon, mahi-mahi, tilapia, or tuna. 

**Cauliflower steaks on the grill**

Cauliflower…is there anything it can’t do? When sliced into thick steaks, you can marinate it and grill it. Like Portobello mushrooms, it has a very meaty quality while being 100% plant-based and perfect for any meatless guests.

**Marinated grilled chicken or tofu**

Undeniably, grilled chicken/tofu is a healthy choice.  All you need is a great marinade, and you’re all set. With so many different marinades to choose from and various herbs to combine for different flavors, you won’t get bored with this option.

**Grilled veggie sandwiches**

Even if you regularly fill your plate with veggies, nothing stands out better than the grilled variety. Grab Portobello mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers and roast them over the open flame. A little misting of olive oil will keep them from sticking without making them soggy. Then, top them on whole grain wrap or bun for a satisfying meal.

**Turkey or Veggie Burgers**

Instead of ground beef, make your burgers with ground turkey.  They taste much lighter and won’t leave you dragging afterward.  Or you can opt for a veggie burger if you want a meat-free option.  Homemade black bean burgers are a big hit in my house! 

**Shrimp Skewers**

And finally, I’d love to remind you that shrimp on the barbie not only tastes fantastic but is also a healthy barbecue dish for your summer shindigs. Marinate them, skewer them, put them on the grill, and enjoy!

What’s your favorite backyard bbq dish?  Comment below and share your favorite pic or recipe the next time you grill out.
