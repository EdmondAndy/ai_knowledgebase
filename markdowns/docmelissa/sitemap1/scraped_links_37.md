# 5 Ways to Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally

By [Doc Melissa](https://docmelissa.com/author/admin/ "Posts by Doc Melissa")April 14, 2018 [No Comments](https://docmelissa.com/5-ways-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-naturally/#respond)




![](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fotolia_38820126_XS.jpg)Finding out your blood pressure is rising can beg the question, why? When blood pressure elevates for extended periods of time, your chronic health risk rises. From vision problems and headaches to more serious complications like erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, think of your blood pressure like a barometer. 

So what can be making it rise and what do you do about it? Did you know that there is more to high blood pressure than salt intake? While your doctor may be recommending medication, you can work with your doctor and reduce your risk or need for medication by taking a few simple steps to lower your blood pressure and improve your health.

1. **Exercise does a body good!** Research shows that regular exercise of 30 minutes 5 days a week will lower your blood pressure by 4 to 9 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  Once you start, keep up the healthy habit so your pressure stays normalized and your health optimized.
2. **Eat your veggies.** Did you know that green leafy veggies and most whole fresh fruits contain high amounts of potassium. This is an essential nutrient counters the effects of high sodium and help to regulate blood pressure.
3. **Lose it.** Ok, lets get real- weight is nothing helpful to hold onto especially if your blood pressure is rising. Studies suggest that just by dropping 10 pounds, you can lower your blood pressure, so lace up and get up, get out and get moving.
4. **Cut out processed and fast food.** If it comes in a box, bag, can or drive thru it is processed and filled with high amounts of sodium. Of course convenience is great but it does come with a cost and in this case, it is costing you your health. By reducing your intake of sodium filled foods you can reduce your blood pressure by 2-8  millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
5. **Take it easy.** What makes your blood boil? When stress strikes, your blood pressure immediately begins to rise due to the fight or flight response.  How do you gain the upper hand? Notice what is triggering you,stop, take a breath and take it easy for just 60 seconds so you can regain control, regulate your blood pressure and reinvigorate your health.

This is just a jump off point to get your health moving in the right direction. Nutrients, supplements, additional lifestyle changes and more may be needed depending on the severity of your problem.  If you want to be sure, we suggest you test your nutrient levels for the exact right levels of support for you.
