# Power Up Your Energy with Super Snacks

![](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dsc08019-3618-smaller.jpg)Looking for an energy boost that will supercharge your brain and body? You hold the key to energize your body, strengthen your mind and optimize your health each time you eat.  Too often we miss meals or choose easy over nutritious. Today I want to help you discover how you can power up your energy, health and life- with super snacks. 

**Watch Out for Power Drainers!**

Before you can increase your energy- you need to be aware of what can actually rob you of it. Store-bought and packaged snacks, chips, crisps, cookies and candy are snacks that zap your power despite the false sense of energy that comes from a “sugar high”. It can be hard not to choose them. They are fun, and hit the taste sensors! But they are often full of sugar and chemicals that cause havoc to the receptors in your brain and hormones in your body that will quickly breakdown and begin to destroy your health. 

Power drainers cause headaches, fatigue and brain fog, so watch out.

**The Dynamic Duo**

Fruit and nuts are the perfect energy duo. They taste great and deliver a dose of blood sugar stabilizing energy with healthy fat, protein and carbohydrates. 

Apples with Almond Butter, Berries and Walnuts, Bananas and Peanut Butter, Grapes and Pecans. 

Fruit and Nuts are rich in vitamins that give you just the boost you need to carry you through your day with focus and vitality. 

* *Almonds are Rich in Calcium and Magnesium*
* *Apples are filled with Vitamin C and are great for heart, gut and immune health.*
* Berries are loaded with Antioxidants and Vitamin C that boosts your immunity.

**Vitality Veggies**

Veggies are the goldmine for nutrition and make for some pretty delicious snacks. The help to promote a healthy microbiome, deliver essential nutrients and are fun to crunch!  Next time you need a boost, try carrots and hummus, celery and guacamole, cauliflower in a ranch dip made out of greek yogurt. Your taste buds will thank you!

So, the next time you need a boost of energy- step away from the chips, cookies and coffee and give your body what it really needs- power packed nutrition for energy, health and vitality. Grab your favorite and be sure to tell us your favorite combos below.
