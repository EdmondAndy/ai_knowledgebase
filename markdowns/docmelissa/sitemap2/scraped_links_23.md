## What are peptides?

Peptides are short-chain amino acids found naturally in the body. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and these particular amino acids are designed to augment specific functions within the human body.

Therapy with peptides uses those sequences already present to regulate and rejuvenate functions, basically, they bind to and tell other cells what to do, replacing or mimicking the functions of naturally occurring peptides. Peptides have the capability to rewrite body chemistry relationships to promote restoration, anabolism, and homeostasis.

# [BPC-157 Spray](https://integrativepeptides.com/drmpetersen/,)

***Gut, Immune, Musculoskeletal, Metabolic, Cognitive Supported Benefits***

*[![](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-drawing-6.png "https://integrativepeptides.com/product/bpc-157-pure-oral-spray/ip/drmelissagp@gmail.com/")](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-drawing-6.png)*

BPC stands for Body Protective Compound, and that is exactly its function. It was originally discovered to be a protective peptide within our gut and to have a healing effect in both our upper and lower GI tract.

**[CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE from our partners at Integrative Peptides.](https://integrativepeptides.com/drmpetersen/,)** 

Presenting a new peppermint-flavored oral spray format of Integrative Peptides’ best-selling product, BPC-157, containing 500 mcg of the systemically active, multi-function peptide.

Known benefits include:

* A useful adjunct to healing almost anything related to the GI tract
* Heals mitochondrial damage
* Accelerated healing of ligaments, bones, and tendons
* Reduces inflammation in autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis,
* Protects endothelium and the formation of scar tissue
* Improves brain health & mood

# [KPV Ultra Oral Spray](https://integrativepeptides.com/drmpetersen/,)

***Anti inflammatory, Immune- Modulation, Benefiting Autoimmune and Inflammatory Conditions***

KPV Ultra oral spray contains 500 mcg of the active bioregulator fragment of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is considered to be one of the body’s most potent regulators of normal immune balance and mast cell system stimulation.[![](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-drawing-7.png)](https://integrativepeptides.com/drmpetersen/,)

KPV Ultra has been formulated into a peppermint-flavored liquid spray to achieve rapid absorption.

Several studies have previously shown that KPV has decreased inflammation and tumorigenesis in the body. The KPV anti-inflammatory effect is PepT1-mediated in intestinal epithelial and immune cells. PepT1 is an oligopeptide transporter that is overexpressed in the colonic epithelial cells of chronic ulcerative colitis, which can deliver KPV into the cytosol in the intestine. The tripeptide, KPV has significant antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, especially in those with psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes the rapid build-up of skin cells and is usually treated using hydrocortisone. In people with psoriasis, KPV has shown to limit symptoms of the condition including itchiness, dryness, redness, peeling, and more. Therefore, KPV could be used for an extended period of time without risking the unwanted complications of long-term steroid therapy. *KPV is a promising, therapeutic treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colon cancer, and inflammatory skin disorders, in particular, psoriasis.*

### Benefits of KPV

* Can treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions
* Can strengthen the immune system
* Can acts as an anti-microbial
* Can improve skin health
* Used in healing wounds & injuries
* Helps with gut health, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) and colitis

# [TB4- FRAG Max](https://integrativepeptides.com/drmpetersen/,)

TB4 Frag Max TB4-Frag Max includes a reformulated version of TB4 Active Frag for 10x potency in addition to a synergistic blend of absorbable bioactive natural thymic peptides. Contains premium low molecular weight thymus extract from ovine (sheep).

**[CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE AT Integrative Peptides TB4-FRAG™ contains the active fragment of the larger peptide Thymosin Beta 4.](https://integrativepeptides.com/drmpetersen/,)**

[![](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-drawing-8.png)](https://docmelissa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-drawing-8.png)**Known benefits include:**

* Boosts your immune system
* Decreases scar tissue formation
* Increases collagen formation
* Used for hair restoration
* Beneficial in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

Thymosin is a hormone secreted from the thymus. Its primary function is to stimulate the production of T cells, which are an important part of the immune system. Thymosin also assists in the development of B cells to plasma cells to produce antibodies. The predominant form of Thymosin, Thymosin Beta 4, is a member of a highly conserved family of actin monomer sequestering proteins. In addition to its role as a major actin-sequestering molecule, Thymosin Beta 4 plays a role in tissue repair. Tβ4 has been found to play an important role in the protection, regeneration and remodeling of injured or damaged tissues. The gene for Tβ4 has also been found to be one of the first to be upregulated after injuries. Thymosin Beta 4 is currently being trialed as a potential therapy for HIV, AIDS, and Influenza. Thymosin Beta 4 is most often prescribed for acute injury, surgical repair and for senior athletes. It has most recently been shown to help regrow hair in addition to PRP.
